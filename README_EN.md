JSP, JSTL, and Servlet Learning Repository
Welcome to my repository where I document my journey in learning Java Server Pages (JSP), Java Servlet
 and JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL). I initiated this learning process through an Udemy course instructed by Chad Darby.

Course Overview
I delved into the following aspects during the course:

JSP Demo
Created the first Hello World application using JSP.
Implemented functionality for buttons, checkboxes, lists, and arrays.
Explored basic cookie integration.
Developed a "to-do list" application.

Tag Demo
Worked extensively with JSTL Tags.
Constructed a multi-lingual application using JSTL and i18n tags.
Created a basic table and populated it with data using JSTL.

Servlet Demo
Developed a Hello World application with Servlet.
Acquired fundamental knowledge of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

Web Student Tracker
Constructed a student tracker database application using Servlet, JSP, and JSTL for the backend.
Utilized MySQL for the database and JDBC for database connectivity.
Implemented the MVC pattern in the project.
Model: StudentDBUtil
View: JSP files
Controller: Servlet
Integrated utilities such as add, delete, update, list, and search functionalities for the database.

Feel free to explore the code provided in each section.
You can learn about JSP, JSTL, and Servlet by examining the examples and the comprehensive web student tracker project.

Happy coding!
